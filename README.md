## About The Project

The Angola Connection Hub provides a centralized REST API for accessing various common data related to Angola. It simplifies the process of retrieving geographical information, financial data (to be expanded), and utilizing validation services for Angolan specific identifiers. The goal is to offer a reliable source of updated information for developers and applications.

## Features

-   Retrieve updated common Angolan data.
-   Filter and search capabilities for data.
-   Validation services (e.g., National ID, Phone Number - to be expanded).

## Built With

This project is built using the following technologies:

-   [Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html)
-   [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
-   [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (for Production)
-   [H2 Database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) (for Development)
-   [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   Git: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-   Java JDK 21 or later: You can download it from [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html) or use an alternative like [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/21/). Ensure `JAVA_HOME` is set up, or your IDE is configured to use this JDK.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/angola-connection-hub.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd angola-connection-hub
    ```
3.  **Run the application using Maven Wrapper:**
    ```sh
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
    (On Windows, use `mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`)

The application should now be running on the default port (usually `8080`).

## Usage

The API provides several endpoints to access data.

Here are some examples of available endpoints:

-   **Get List of Provinces:**
    ```http
    GET /api/v1/geography/provinces
    ```
    **Description:** Retrieves a list of all Angolan provinces.

*(You can add more endpoints here as they become available)*
